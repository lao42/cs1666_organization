# Physics advanced topic presentation outline

* **Quick basic intro (5-10 min)**
	* Intro to computer simulation:
	* Types: Equations-based, agent-based (individual-based), multiscale, monte carlo
	* Purposes: wide range of fields use computer simulations, including physics. Computer simulations have 3 main purposes which are for Predicting/generating data, understanding given data, and also for exploratory/heuristic purposes. Simulations give reliable predictions when experiments are not possible or very difficult.

* **Explosion Simulation (40 min)**
	* General concept of explosion in physics (conservation of momentumâ€¦) (10 min)
		* https://openoregon.pressbooks.pub/bodyphysics/chapter/locomotion/ 
		* https://imechanica.org/files/physics-I_0.pdf
	* Since we would be using equations-based computer simulations for our physics engines, we will be looking at different physics equations that we would need to implement to simulate the energy in an explosion. (20 min)

			* Need to use Pitt account thru hillman to access
	* Rust/Pseudo code: how we would implement this in our game (10 min)
